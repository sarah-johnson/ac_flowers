<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
If you have a random white flower on your island, you can't tell its genes. Depending
on those underlying genes, it could be capable of producing beautiful hybrids, but it
might also be incapable of producing anything other than more white flowers. But if you
observe the children of a breeding pair, you can make inferences about the underlying
genetics of the parent flowers. This calculator uses a bit of probability and statistics
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes' Theorem</a> to
make those predictions. Given a parent color, we assume to start with equal chances that
flower could have any underlying genes. This isn't a perfect assumption, since the real
distribution of flowers on your island is weighted based on seeds or natural flowers you
started with. But the nice thing about Bayes's theorem is that our choice of "priors"
matters less and less the more observations we get.

You can use this tool to track the probable genetics of flowers in your town. I have been
using it on my quest for purple hyacinths, as when breeding blue and orange, it's easy
to identify special blues based on their offspring.
