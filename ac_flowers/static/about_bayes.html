<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
If you have a random white flower on your island, you can't tell its genes. Depending
on those underlying genes, it may or may not be capable of producing a given target color.
If you observe the children of a breeding pair, you can make inferences about the underlying
genetics of the parent flowers. This calculator uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes' Theorem</a> to
make those predictions. Given a parent color, we assume to start with equal chances that
flower could have any underlying genes. This isn't a perfect assumption, since the real
distribution of flowers on your island is weighted based on seeds or natural flowers you
started with. But the nice thing about Bayes's theorem is that our choice of "priors"
matters less and less the more observations we get.
